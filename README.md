[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pituki/LastCall.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pituki/LastCall)

### This feature adds more functionality than just the last call   

Tool to handle Backbone.sync(). What we want to be able to do is:  

1. Register the async calls and abort the previous request if a new request is initialzed.  
2. Know what views are assigned to current view that have AJAX requests that we want to terminate.  

### To Do  
1. Determine if we are trying to terminate the last call
2. If we have multiple views, how we will determine which of the views we are terminating the AJAX request 



Example:
